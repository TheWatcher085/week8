        <p id="word">Remember! The law in Night City exists for a reason. Ignorance isn't bliss if you're dead - this applies to adults, but especially to minors.
         That's why we've created an educational new cartoon series called "Safe 'n' Sound" which instructs, entertains, and prepares kids for life in today's modern cities.
         Meet two loveable dogs - the conscientious Sgt. Dobs and the silly, bumbling Mr. Puggins. They're here to give you and YOUR loved ones everything you need to increase
         your chances of living a long and happy life. </p>
