        <p>In recent years the NCPD (night City Police Department) has been the subject of various rumors.
         Out of concern for your trust and safety, we have decided to cut through the chaos of misinformation and dispel some of the most widely-circulated claims abut us.</p> <br>
        </div>

        <h2>Three questions about the NCPD</h2> <br>

        <ol id="word">
            <li>Q: Will NCPD Officers protect me in all areas of Night City?</li>
            <p>A: Sadly, no. The NCPD can only ensure the safety of night Citizens in districts such as City Center 
            or North Oak. Areas such as Pacifica and the Combat Zone do not fall under our jurisdiction. it's also worth
            remembering that the NCPD does not patrol corporate territories, or any territories, or any territory outside
            of Night City limits.</p> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Q: Is the NCPD funded by corporations?</li>
            <p>A: No, The NCPD recieves funding directly from the Office of the Mayor and the City Council.
            Corporations have no influence on us. Relying on their fiancial resources would be akin to corruption, 
            which is something we would obviously want to avoid. Our officers are not as well equipped as their corparate 
            counterparts, but they more than make up for it with their moral compass and sense of public duty.</p> <br> <br> <br>

            <li>Q: Do officers in the MaxTac unit take civilians and their lives into account?</li>
            <p>A: Yes. The idea that MaxTac officers aim to neutralize cyberpsychos at all costs is a blatant falsehood. 
            Their priority is to minimize damage and loss of human life. Unfortunately, accidents sometimes occur, and for 
            that we deeply apologize.</p> <br> <br> <br>
        </ol>
